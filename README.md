# WCAG

### A websites must be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of proving a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.

WCAG is primarily intended for:

* Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.)
* Web authoring tool developers
* Web accessibility evaluation tool developers
* Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility

See the [WCAG 2.0 FAQ](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/wcag2faq) for more information.

# Why WCAG

### Not only are there ethical and commercial justifications for implementing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, there are also [legal reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines#Legal_obligations).

In a few countries businesses that have an online presence should provide accessibility to disabled users. If a business's website does not meet the Accessibility Guidelines, then the website owner could be sued for discrimination.

The Australian Government has also mandated via the [Disability Discrimination Act 1992](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426) that all Australian Government websites meet the WCAG accessibility requirements.

The Israeli Ministry of Justice recently published regulations requiring Internet websites to comply with Israeli standard 5568, which is based on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.

In the US, Section 508 is being (slowly) refreshed to harmonize with WCAG 2. The European Commission has moved to WCAG 2 as a European government standard. The governments of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the UK have [already adopted WCAG 2](http://www.powermapper.com/blog/government-accessibility-standards/).
